# No_Glow from device to router

## 4-step tutorial

### How to be the most safe and secure online.

*Some of these steps can be done on a regular computer, but to build a really secure (or ''anonymous'') configuration, you need to dedicate a second computer and a second router (ex. cheap Coreboot compatible Lenovo ThinkPad and a cheap Mango GL.iNet router)*

1. Device
     - Coreboot
     - ME_Cleaner & AMD PSP

2. OS
     - Qubes-Whonix
     - Tails
     - Others (Open or HardenedBSD, etc.)
  
3. Software
     - Invidious (Youtube)
     - Matrix Chat (register over Tor, etc.)
     - i2p
     - SOCKS5

4. Router
     - OpenWrt
     - Tomato (Fresh/Advanced)
     - DNSCrypt (for when non Tor, clearnet)

5. Extras
     - Jellyfin (Open source ''Netflix/Plex'')
     - JMP.CHAT/FragmentTON/XMPP
     - Streamio
     - Emailwiz (lukesmith)
     - GrapheneOS (Pixel)
     - Monero
     - Tomato (Fresh/Advanced)
     - DNSCrypt (for when non Tor, clearnet)

## Corebooted Computer (from easiest to hardest)

### Why?

Intel

Coreboot, formerly known as LinuxBIOS, is a software project aimed at replacing closed source proprietary firmware (BIOS or UEFI) found in most computers with a lightweight firmware designed to perform only the minimum number of tasks necessary to load and run a modern 32-bit or 64-bit operating system.

Since Coreboot initializes the bare hardware, it must be ported to every chipset and motherboard that it supports. As a result, coreboot is available only for a limited number of hardware platforms and motherboard models. (mostly Lenovo Thinkpads & Chromebooks)

AMD

AMD PSP ... ''IME for AMD''

Phenom II are the strongest CPU before 2013 when AMDPSP came into existance.

### How?

   *You can find devices with Coreboot (Skulls, Libreboot, Heads) on eBay or from System76, Purism, Nitro, FSF and more.*

Skulls pre-built coreboot image for Lenovo Thinkpad (t430, t440p, t530, w530, x230, x230t)

## 2. The OS
   Of course Winblows (spyware) is not a secure and anonymous OS.
   
## 3. Software

## 4. Router

## 5. Extras

Inside your OS, you cannot do everything and open a browser and open all that javascript crap.
