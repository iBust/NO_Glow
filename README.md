# No_Glow from device to router

## 4-step tutorial

### How to be the most safe and secure online.

*Some of these steps can be done on a regular computer (and if compatible, even on some regular home router) but to build a really secure (or ''anonymous'') configuration, you need to dedicate a second computer and a second router (ex. a cheap eBay Corebooted ThinkPad (200$) and a cheap Mango GL.iNet router (20$)

1. Device
     - Coreboot
     - ME_Cleaner

2. OS
     - Qubes-Whonix
     - Tails
     - Others (Open or HardenedBSD, etc.)
  
3. Software
     - Invidious (Youtube)
     - Matrix Chat (register over Tor, etc.)
     - i2p
     - SOCKS5

4. Router
     - OpenWrt
     - DNSCrypt (for when non Tor, clearnet)

## **Device**
   
Hardware from most secure to reasonably secure

*See Bunnie's (OG XBOX Hacker) **Precursor** (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8BA6_9HCzk) Mobile, Open Hardware, RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) Development Kit and **Novena** open source hardware laptop!*

**A Corebooted computer** (from easiest to hardest)

## Why?

Coreboot, formerly known as LinuxBIOS, is a software project aimed at replacing closed source proprietary firmware (BIOS or UEFI) found in most computers with a lightweight firmware designed to perform only the minimum number of tasks necessary to load and run a modern 32-bit or 64-bit operating system.

Since Coreboot initializes the bare hardware, it must be ported to every chipset and motherboard that it supports. As a result, coreboot is available only for a limited number of hardware platforms and motherboard models. (mostly Lenovo Thinkpads & Chromebooks)

## How?



   *You can also find corebooted devices on Ebay or Google for sale, System76, Purism, Nitro and FSF have some.*

## 2. The OS
   Of course Winblows (spyware) is not a secure and anonymous OS.
   
## 3. Software

## 4. Router

## 5. Extras

Inside your OS, you cannot do everything and open a browser and open all that javascript crap.
