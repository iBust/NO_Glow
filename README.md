1. **Device**
Hardware from most secure to ''reasonably'' secure (of course it depends on TOCTOU and all the rest etc.)
The most secure device is the OG XBOX hacker Precursor (Bunnies) https://precursor.dev/
   A computer that is
     Corebooted (from easiest to hardest)
       Lenovo Thinkpad (t430, t440p, t530, w530, x230, x230t)
         Skulls pre-built coreboot (https://github.com/merge/skulls)

  Libreboot (https://notabug.org/libreboot/lbmk)
       Coreboot (https://notabug.org/libreboot/lbmk
       MrChromebox (https://mrchromebox.tech/)
     ME_Cleaned
       
   
   -
   - , ME_Cleaner, less blob possible)
   -You can also find corebooted devices on Ebay or Google for sale, System76, Purism, Nitro and FSF have some but buy at your own risk!

2. The OS
   Of course Winblows (spyware) is not a secure and anonymous OS.
   
4. The second step is your OS.



5. Content

Inside your OS, you cannot do everything and open a browser and open all that javascript crap.
